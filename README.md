# Stock Peak Prediction with Neural Networks

## Description
This project aims to predict the peaks of financial assets of different magnitudes using advanced machine learning techniques, approaching it as a time series problem. We use Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutions to analyze and predict individual patterns, then bring everything together and apply graph theory techniques to relate them.

## Features
- **Temporality:** Daily
- **Time Series Modeling:** Implementation of RNNs to capture long-term temporal dependencies.
- **Peak Prediction:** Ability to accurately identify peaks in financial assets, facilitating investment decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas for data handling
